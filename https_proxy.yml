# Configure overcloud hosts to use an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server
# In this example the proxy server is hosted by seed-vm.
# A single HTTP proxy URL provides service for both HTTP and HTTPS.

# Note: with the values written to /etc/environment the config
#       applied to bashrc could potentially be skipped.
